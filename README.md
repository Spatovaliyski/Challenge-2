# Challenge 2 description:

 The design was created with desktop prioritization. It was then scaled down for tablets/larger phones and finally for small phone screens.
 
 No grids were used, It was directly adapted with percentages.
 I couldn't match all the fonts. The testimonial title font is definitely "Microsoft New Tai Lue"
